# Beyond fear go viral: A machine learning study on infodemic detection during covid-19 pandemic. 

This is **the sample datasets and the sample code** for InCIT2021: The 6th International Conference on Information Technology
with the paper title: Beyond fear go viral: A machine learning study on infodemic detection during covid-19 pandemic. 
We have implemented our methods in Keras.

Please note that in order to run the code:
1. The path should be speficied correctly based on each local computer <br>
2. The model parameters should be speficied differently depend on the grid-search range
